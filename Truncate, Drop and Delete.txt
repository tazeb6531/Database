DELETE, TRUNCATE AND DROP

1. DROP
- DROP is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command 
- used to remove table definition and indexes, data, constraints, triggers etc for that table.
- Performance-wise the DROP command is quick to perform but slower than TRUNCATE because it gives rise to complications.
- Unlike DELETE we canâ€™t rollback the data after using the DROP command.
- In the DROP command, table space is freed from memory because it permanently delete table as well as all its contents.
- Undo is not possible
		Syntax of DROP Command-
		  DROP TaBLE tableName;

2. TRUNCATE
- TRUNCATE is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command.
- TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the rows from the table.Which is a table loch and the whole table is locked to remove all records.
- TRUNCATE command does not free the table space from memory.
-  view of table exist.
- integrity constraints will not be removed.
- undo space is used but less than DELETE.
- this command is faster than DROP and delete.
- we can't use where clause
		TRUNCATETABLE Customers;  
	
3. DELETE
- DELETE is a DML command.
- DELETE is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion.
- We can use where clause with DELETE to filter & delete specific records.
- The DELETE command is used to remove rows from a table based on WHERE condition.
- It maintains the log, so it slower than TRUNCATE.
- The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row.
- Identity of column keep DELETE retains the identity.
- To use Delete you need DELETE permission on the table.
- Delete uses more transaction space than the Truncate statement.
- The delete can be used with indexed views.
		DELETE FROM Customers;  
		OR
		DELETE Customer --- is also possible
		OR
		DELETE from  WHERE  ;
